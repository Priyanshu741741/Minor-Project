                    PEC Dispensary provides a comprehensive appointment scheduling
                    system that allows patients to book appointments online. Healthcare
                    providers can view, manage, and update appointments in real-time.
                    The system sends automatic reminders to patients and maintains
                    a complete history of all visits and prescriptions.

                    How does the NLP feedback analysis work?

                  <AccordionContent>
                    PEC Dispensary uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Neural
                    Networks (NN) to analyze patient feedback in real-time. The system
                    can identify sentiment patterns, detect potential disease outbreaks,
                    and generate actionable insights from patient comments. This helps
                    healthcare providers respond quickly to emerging health concerns
                    and improve overall patient care quality.

                    How does the system know when to generate a disease outbreak alert?
                  </AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze both doctor remarks and patient feedback. It automatically identifies and counts keywords for recurring symptoms like "fever," "cough," and "cold". When the count for these symptoms exceeds a set threshold within a specific timeframe, the system automatically triggers a health alert. These alerts are then displayed on the frontend dashboard for all users to see.

                    How accurate is the machine learning model for patient feedback analysis?
                  </AccordionTrigger>
                  <AccordionContent>
                    The system uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model to analyze patient feedback and determine overall user satisfaction through sentiment analysis. The model&apos;s accuracy is measured by its Mean Absolute Error (MAE), which is 0.7687. This means, on average, the model&apos;s predicted rating is very close to the actual rating the user gave.
