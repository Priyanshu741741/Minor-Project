# Appointments & Data Fetching Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Method Name Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: Frontend was calling `appointmentAPI.getAll()` and `visitAPI.getAll()` but the API file defined these methods as `getMyAppointments()` and `getMyVisits()`
   - **Fixed in**: 
     - `frontend/src/pages/Appointments.jsx` - Changed `appointmentAPI.getAll()` to `appointmentAPI.getMyAppointments()`
     - `frontend/src/pages/Visits.jsx` - Changed `visitAPI.getAll()` to `visitAPI.getMyVisits()`

### 2. **Data Structure Mismatch**
   - **Problem**: Backend returns doctor data with nested `doctor_profile` object, but frontend was trying to access properties directly on the doctor object
   - **Backend structure**: 
     ```javascript
     {
       doctor: {
         full_name: "...",
         doctor_profile: {
           specialization: "...",
           bio: "...",
           license_number: "..."
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - **Fixed in**:
     - `frontend/src/pages/Appointments.jsx` - Changed `doctor.specialization` to `doctor.doctor_profile?.specialization`
     - `frontend/src/pages/BookAppointment.jsx` - Changed `doctor.specialization` to `doctor.doctor_profile?.specialization`
     - `frontend/src/pages/Doctors.jsx` - Updated all doctor profile property accesses to use `doctor.doctor_profile.*`

### 3. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - **Added**: Better request/response interceptors in `frontend/src/lib/api.js` for debugging
   - **Features**:
     - Logs all outgoing requests with method and URL
     - Logs all successful responses with status code
     - Logs detailed error information for failed requests
     - Helps identify whether the issue is network-related, authentication-related, or data-related

## How to Test

1. **Ensure Backend is Running**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server should be running on http://localhost:4000

2. **Ensure Frontend is Running**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the Following Flows**:
   - Login as a patient
   - Navigate to "Book Appointment" - Verify doctors list loads correctly
   - Book an appointment - Verify it saves to database
   - Navigate to "My Appointments" - Verify appointments display correctly with doctor info
   - Login as a doctor
   - Navigate to "Visits" - Verify visit history loads correctly

## Configuration Verified

✅ Backend `.env`:
```
PORT=4000
DATABASE_URL="..."
JWT_SECRET="..."
```

✅ Frontend `.env`:
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

✅ Backend Routes:
- `/api/appointments` → appointmentRoutes (GET, POST)
- `/api/visits` → visitRoutes (GET, POST)
- `/api/profiles/doctors` → profileRoutes (GET)

✅ Authentication:
- Token is stored in localStorage
- Token is sent with every request via Authorization header
- Auth middleware properly extracts userId and role

## Root Cause Summary

The main issues were:
1. **Incorrect method names** in the frontend calling non-existent API functions
2. **Data structure assumptions** where frontend expected flat objects but backend returned nested structures
3. **Lack of error visibility** making it hard to debug the actual issue

All issues have been resolved. The appointments, visits, and doctor listings should now work correctly!
